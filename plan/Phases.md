## Development Phases

1. Project Setup

   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create project structure
   - Set up MongoDB server

2. Database Schema Design

   - Design and implement MongoDB schemas for all entities
   - Implement relationships between schemas

3. Backend Development

   - Set up Express server
   - Implement user authentication and authorization
   - Develop API endpoints for all modules
   - Implement MRP calculation logic
   - Create data validation and error handling middleware

4. Frontend Development

   - Set up Vite + React project
   - Implement UI components using TailwindCSS
   - Create pages for each module
   - Develop forms for CRUD operations
   - Implement role-based access control on the frontend

5. Integration and Testing

   - Connect frontend with backend API
   - Implement end-to-end testing
   - Perform user acceptance testing

6. Documentation and Deployment

   - Write API documentation
   - Create user manual
   - Set up Docker configuration
   - Deploy application

7. Maintenance and Updates
   - Address bug fixes and feature requests
   - Implement performance optimizations
   - Add new features as needed

   - Develop forms for all CRUD operations
   - Implement client-side validation

4. Security Implementation

   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add input sanitization and validation

5. Testing

   - Write unit tests for backend services
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Develop end-to-end tests for critical user flows

6. Deployment

   - Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
   - Configure production environment variables

7. Documentation
   - Write API documentation using Swagger or similar tool
   - Create user manual for different roles
   - Document deployment and maintenance procedures
